# Method

## Problem target

This topic studies whether UET-style scaling and complexity rules can organize selected complex-systems benchmarks across domains.

The current audit-backed method is narrower than the topic title: the primary verifier is the HRV branch. Other branches are retained as research surfaces until they receive their own source-backed data manifests, formula rows, baselines, thresholds, and artifacts.

## Core components

### Engine components
- `Code/01_Engine/Engine_Complexity.py`
- `Code/01_Engine/Engine_Econophysics.py`

### Proof-oriented components
- `Code/02_Proof/Proof_Power_Law.py`

### Research and comparison components
- `Code/03_Research/Research_Biology_HRV.py`
- `Code/03_Research/Research_Brain.py`
- `Code/03_Research/Research_Climate.py`

The reviewed formula registry is `FORMULA_AUDIT.md`.

## Variable framing

- Primary modeled quantities: scaling exponents, network-style complexity measures, dynamical features, and coupling terms
- Current verifier-backed quantities: RR interval summary statistics, SDNN, RMSSD, Poincare-style `sd1/sd2`, and a local equilibrium score.

## Evidence matrix

| Branch | Current implementation | Evidence class | Use in theory |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| HRV branch | Source-referenced derived-RR benchmark with artifact | `C/B` | Primary verifier lane only. |
| SOC branch | Engine/formula sandbox | `D` | Simulation lane only. |
| Econophysics branch | Local market simulation scripts | `D` | Exploratory branch only. |
| Climate branch | Local series branch without verifier gate | `D` | Exploratory branch only. |
| Inequality/social branches | Local working files without verifier artifacts | `D` | Exploratory branch only. |
| Source / claim workflow | Intake, readiness, and branch-claim gates | `Workflow gate` | Prevents broad cross-domain claims from outrunning branch evidence. |

## Assumptions

- The topic uses heterogeneous local case studies rather than one uniform benchmark family.
- Cross-domain metrics are not dimensionally comparable until each branch declares its own unit convention, preprocessing, and baseline.

## Domain of validity

- Selected biology, brain, plasma, or econophysics-style files stored in the topic workspace.
- Current pass/fail interpretation is limited to the HRV verifier run contract.

## Excluded cases

- A universal causal law that rigorously covers all complex systems.
- Market-crash prediction, climate sensitivity validation, inequality explanation, and theorem-level SOC proof.

## Parameter sensitivity note

- Normalization choices and dataset stitching strongly affect current cross-domain interpretations.

## Claim Workflow

1. Run `Research_Biology_HRV.py` to regenerate the artifact and workflow files.
2. Fill `Data/03_Research/source_evidence_intake_stub.json` only with real branch-specific source evidence.
3. Use `Data/03_Research/source_evidence_readiness_matrix.json` as the provenance gate before changing working-copy data or claim class.
4. Check `Data/03_Research/branch_claim_gate.json` before treating SOC, econophysics, climate, inequality, or social branches as evidence.
