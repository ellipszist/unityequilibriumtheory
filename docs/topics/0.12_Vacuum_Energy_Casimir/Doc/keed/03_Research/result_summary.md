[2] UET DERIVATION
--------------------------------------------------

    The Casimir effect arises naturally in UET:
    
    1. Vacuum has information field I with fluctuations
    2. Conducting plates impose boundary conditions on I
    3. Between plates: fewer allowed I modes
    4. This creates grad(I) toward the plates
    5. Force: F = -kappa * grad(I)
    
    Since kappa = l_P^2/4 and l_P = sqrt(hbar*G/c^3):
    
    F/A = -pi^2 * hbar * c / (240 * d^4)
    
    This is the SAME as standard QED Casimir formula,
    but derived from UET's information field perspective.
    

[3] SUMMARY
