# Limitations

- The current strict binding-energy verifier uses a source-backed extracted subset of AME2020, while the wider parsed table is reported through a separate diagnostic artifact rather than a hard pass/fail gate.
- Heavy nuclei pass the current gate, but light nuclei are still intentionally excluded from the strict liquid-drop validation regime.
- The full-table diagnostic layer is expected to show much weaker performance for lighter nuclei, so the topic should not be described as uniformly accurate across the whole AME2020 parsed table.
- The engine uses fixed semi-empirical coefficients plus a UET correction term, so this topic should not yet be presented as fully parameter-free.
- Only the heavy-nucleus subset branch and proton-radius benchmark-anchor branch are currently accepted by the branch claim gate.
- `nuclear_claim_scope_gate` allows those selected checks while blocking full-table, light-nuclei, QCD, hadron-mass, confinement, and complete strong-force exports.
- PDG quark-mass and hadron-mass layers are still partly legacy local snapshots and should be upgraded separately.
- The proton-radius path currently returns a benchmark-anchor value and should not be described as an independent radius prediction.
- The QCD bridge contains diagnostic/open branches, including a data-shape bug in `alpha_s_uet_v2`, and should not support public QCD-running claims until hardened.
- The color-confinement proof script currently prints a pass/fail-style message but returns `True`, so it is not an audit-grade proof gate.
- Internal script execution does not by itself establish external replication, theorem-level proof, or broad physical closure.
