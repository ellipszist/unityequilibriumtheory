# 0.2 Black Hole Physics

> [!NOTE]
> **AI-Digest**: This topic currently supports an internal EHT shadow-size benchmark and
> documents heuristic UET saturation-core diagnostics. It does not yet establish a complete
> singularity-resolution proof, GR replacement, or CCBH cosmological-coupling result.

## Current Claim Boundary

The primary verifier checks whether the current engine reproduces selected EHT angular
shadow sizes for M87* and Sgr A* using the topic-local working-copy data package. The
saturation-core mechanism and CCBH mass-growth path remain hardening targets until their
scale choices, upstream data, and acceptance thresholds are fully locked.

## Problem And Method

- The physics target is the black-hole horizon/shadow benchmark plus a proposed UET
  information-saturation mechanism for avoiding divergent core behavior.
- The current verifier uses the EHT shadow-size data path because the relevant local inputs
  are available inside the repository.
- The CCBH path is scientifically important but cannot serve as the primary gate until the
  Shen/Kormendy upstream datasets are stored and hashed under `docs/data/external/...`.

## Key Files

- `FORMULA_AUDIT.md`: formula, unit, constant, proof-status, and failure-mode registry.
- `VERIFICATION_SPEC.md`: primary command, thresholds, artifact, and interpretation.
- `DATA_MANIFEST.md`: current data posture and provenance gaps.
- `METHOD.md`: topic method scope and dependency policy.
- `LIMITATIONS.md`: blockers that prevent stronger claims.
- `Data/03_Research/source_evidence_intake_stub.json`: provenance intake for EHT, GW, and CCBH lanes.
- `Data/03_Research/source_evidence_readiness_matrix.json`: readiness gate for source review.
- `Data/03_Research/branch_claim_gate.json`: branch-level claim ceiling.

## Current Limitations

- The EHT data package is still a topic-local working copy, not a fully normalized archival
  upstream source package.
- The shadow benchmark uses a compact `5.2 R_s` relation rather than full image-domain
  ray-tracing.
- The UET core-stabilization path uses rescaled numerical diagnostics and still needs a
  physically locked saturation scale.
- The CCBH analysis needs real upstream data archived in the repo before it can support
  claim upgrades.
