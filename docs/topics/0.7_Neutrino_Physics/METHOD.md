# Method

## Problem target

This topic studies whether current UET-style neutrino structure can reproduce selected mixing-angle and mass-splitting benchmarks when checked against official NuFIT 6.0 ranges, and whether the absolute neutrino-mass engine path remains compatible with the official KATRIN 2025 direct mass limit.

## Variable framing

- Primary modeled quantities: mixing angles, mass-squared differences, PMNS-style parameters, and selected decay observables.

## Assumptions

- The primary benchmark for oscillation parameters should now come from the official NuFIT 6.0 parameter table.
- The direct absolute-mass benchmark should come from the official KATRIN 2025 latest-results page.
- Geometric angle outputs are treated separately from runtime benchmark-fed mass splittings.
- The absolute-mass branch uses a see-saw-style relation `m_nu = v^2 / M_I`, so the electroweak scale `v` and the heavy information scale `M_I` must be expressed in the same unit system before converting the final result to eV.

## Domain of validity

- Selected three-flavor oscillation parameters under normal ordering, benchmarked against official NuFIT 6.0 ranges.

## Excluded cases

- A complete neutrino-sector theory across all matter effects, sterile sectors, or cosmological constraints.

## Parameter sensitivity note

- The current angle checks are closer to genuine UET outputs than the mass-splitting checks.
- The runtime mass splittings still come from benchmark-fed parameters inside the engine, so they should not yet be described as fully first-principles derivations.
- The direct absolute-mass engine path is distinct from the oscillation benchmark path and therefore must be audited separately against KATRIN rather than inferred from the NuFIT pass alone.
- The major blocker found in the previous KATRIN fail was a dimensional inconsistency: the earlier engine mixed SI-kilogram Planck mass with an electroweak scale written in GeV and inserted an extra `1e-6` bridge factor. The current branch repairs that unit mismatch by keeping the see-saw relation in GeV and converting to eV only at the end.
