# 0.20 Atomic Physics

> [!NOTE]
> **AI-Digest**: This topic currently has a source-backed hydrogen Rydberg benchmark using a NIST hydrogen spectrum working copy and CODATA `R_H`. The current artifact supports internal hydrogen-spectrum agreement only; it does not yet prove a UET derivation of the Rydberg formula or validate fine structure, Lamb shift, helium, or many-electron atoms.

## Research Role

Topic `0.20` is the atomic benchmark layer for UET. Its near-term job is to make hydrogen spectral formulas, constants, NIST data, and residual thresholds auditable before the theory uses atomic physics as evidence for broader information-channel claims.

## Evidence and Status Matrix

| Layer | Current status | Evidence path | Claim allowed now | Blocker |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Data | NIST/CODATA source-labeled working copies | `Data/03_Research/nist_hydrogen_spectrum.json`, `codata_2018_atomic.json` | Hydrogen line and constant inputs are inspectable with hashes. | Wavelength precision and source-transcription notes still need normalization. |
| Formula | Reviewed registry | `FORMULA_AUDIT.md` | Rydberg relation, `R_H` checkpoint, and residual metrics are mapped to code. | UET derivation of `R_H` is not artifact-backed. |
| Verification | Runnable primary artifact | `Code/03_Research/Research_Rydberg_Validation.py` | Supports hydrogen-spectrum internal benchmark claims. | Many-electron and QED effects are outside the verifier. |
| Source evidence workflow | Structured provenance gate | `Data/03_Research/source_evidence_intake_stub.json`, `source_evidence_readiness_matrix.json` | source-review queue | Level-energy, precision, and many-electron packages still need dedicated artifacts. |
| Branch claim gate | Structured claim ceiling | `Data/03_Research/branch_claim_gate.json` | benchmark-only claim control | Hydrogen benchmark does not promote full atomic-theory claims. |
| Claims | Bounded to hydrogen benchmark | this README, `METHOD.md`, `LIMITATIONS.md` | May state that selected hydrogen lines match the standard Rydberg relation within declared thresholds. | Cannot claim full atomic theory or first-principles UET derivation. |
| Dependencies | Atomic constants/levels bridge | `0.6`, `0.17`, `0.21`, `0.23`, `0.0` | Downstream topics may cite the hydrogen benchmark with limitations. | Stronger claims need fine-structure/many-electron artifacts. |
