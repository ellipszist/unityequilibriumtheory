# Formula Audit: 0.11 Phase Transitions

## Scope

This registry covers the current phase-transition calculation paths: spectral
Cahn-Hilliard evolution, chemical potential, free-energy/order-parameter diagnostics, BEC
critical temperature, 3D Ising critical-exponent comparison, and competitor/test solvers. It
separates standard benchmark relations from UET heuristic projection claims and numerical
demonstrations.

## Current Formula Boundary

- The strongest current result is a selected beta-exponent internal benchmark.
- Spectral Cahn-Hilliard simulation demonstrates a normalized mechanism but is not yet mapped
  to physical material units.
- Order emergence and symmetry-breaking language must remain model/diagnostic wording unless
  backed by broader exponent, morphology, and material-data gates.

## Wave 5 Formula Boundary

The spatial-coupled operator is now available as an opt-in core candidate, but the current
scaling artifact does not support a claim that UET escapes mean-field behavior. The allowed
claim is limited to: a candidate spatial operator exists, its interface/zero-field gates pass,
and its current scaling result remains diagnostic-only.

## Wave 6 Coefficient Boundary

The coefficient sensitivity diagnostic narrows the blocker: changing the current candidate
coefficients alone did not shift the fitted beta exponent toward the 3D Ising target. The
allowed claim is limited to: coefficient-only tuning remains mean-field-like under the tested
grid, so the next hardening step needs a revised operator form, nonlocal/scale-dependent term,
or correlation-length-aware estimator.

## Wave 7 Estimator Boundary

The correlation-length diagnostic shows that the current synthetic temperature window does not
expose strong connected correlation-length growth. The allowed claim is limited to: beta-only
order-parameter fits are not enough for universality promotion, and the next hardening step
needs finite-size/correlation-length-aware scaling plus an operator form that separates from
baseline behavior.

## Wave 8 Finite-Size Boundary

The finite-size diagnostic shows that grid coverage and Binder-style proxy spread are not the
limiting issue by themselves. The current blocker is that near-critical `xi/L` remains too
small and the spatial lane does not separate from the TDGL baseline, so finite-size scaling
claims remain blocked.

## Wave 9 Relaxation Boundary

The critical-window relaxation diagnostic shows that moving closer to `Tc` and increasing
steps up to `2800` does not lift the spatial candidate out of local-correlation behavior. The
next hardening step must change the dynamics/operator form or add a better critical-growth
mechanism before rerunning finite-size claims.

## Wave 10 Operator-Form Requirement Boundary

The operator-form requirement gate aggregates the Wave 5-9 evidence chain into a design
controller. It does not validate a new equation. It records that the current `spatial_coupled_v1`
family has core-engine availability but still lacks coefficient, finite-size, critical-window,
and operator-separation support for a dynamics claim. The next hardening step must introduce a
new opt-in operator form with explicit unit/proxy boundaries, unit tests, formula-audit entries,
and fresh scaling artifacts before any claim is upgraded.

## Wave 11 Spatial-Coupled V2 Boundary

The first `spatial_coupled_v2` candidate moves beyond coefficient-only tuning by adding screened
nonlocal space-memory contrast and a conserved interface/game drive in the core engine. The
candidate passes availability, zero/uniform-field safety, conserved-force, and short-run
stability checks. It does not pass dynamics-claim gates: v2 `xi/L` remains below the baseline
lane in the first diagnostic, so the current evidence only supports continued operator-design
work.

## Wave 12 V2 Component-Ablation Boundary

The component-ablation diagnostic shows that the current v2 failure is not isolated to only one
combined lane. Information-only, game-only, full, short-memory, and long-memory profiles are all
stable and force-isolated, but none improves the correlation-length proxy over baseline. The
current v2 component family therefore remains diagnostic-only and should not be promoted by
recombining or retuning those components alone.

## Wave 13 Model C Boundary

The Model C diagnostic is the first post-v2 path that passes mechanism triage. It uses the topic
Cahn-Hilliard engine instead of a hidden standalone equation, conserves the mean order parameter,
and produces stronger domain/correlation growth than the nonconserved comparison lane. The
allowed claim is limited to: Model C is a plausible mechanism-level repair direction. It is not
yet a core UET operator replacement, 3D finite-size scaling result, material validation, or
universality-class proof.

## Wave 14 Conserved-Order Core Boundary

The `conserved_order_v1` core mode exposes a Model C-style conserved flow without changing
legacy defaults. It passes the core exposure, legacy compatibility, Wave 13 bridge, and mass
conservation gates. It does not yet pass the mechanism-response gate: the explicit finite-
difference core candidate produces weaker `xi` growth than the legacy core comparison in the
current diagnostic. The allowed claim is limited to opt-in availability and conservation, not
validated phase-transition dynamics.

## Wave 15 Numerics-Gap Boundary

The numerics-gap diagnostic does not introduce a new physics claim. It records that the Wave 14
explicit finite-difference core path is not the right next replacement path for reproducing the
Wave 13 spectral Cahn-Hilliard response: the Wave 13-like explicit stiffness proxy is far above
the declared viability threshold. The allowed claim is limited to a next-implementation
requirement: use a spectral or semi-implicit conserved-order core candidate before rerunning
finite-size, exponent, or universality gates.

## Wave 16 Spectral-Core Boundary

The `conserved_order_spectral_v1` core mode repairs the Wave 15 implementation blocker by
matching the topic spectral Cahn-Hilliard engine under normalized Wave 13-like settings while
preserving legacy defaults. The allowed claim is limited to: an opt-in core spectral bridge now
exists and passes mechanism/implementation gates. It is not yet a finite-size scaling result,
critical-exponent result, material validation, RG closure, or universal phase-transition proof.

## Wave 17 Spectral-Scaling Boundary

The spectral-scaling diagnostic is the first finite-size/exponent gate for `conserved_order_spectral_v1`.
It supports stability and coverage, but it does not support universality promotion: the near-critical
`xi/L` window remains below threshold and the fitted beta proxy is far from the 3D Ising benchmark.
The allowed claim is limited to: the next blocker is finite-size/equilibration/scaling-window design.

## Wave 18 Window-Repair Boundary

The window-repair diagnostic shows that the blocker is not fixed by simply running longer or moving
closer to `Tc`. Increasing `kappa` can raise `xi/L`, but the passing `xi/L` cases lose the order
signal below the declared floor. The allowed claim is limited to: the next repair must preserve
order amplitude while improving finite-size correlation structure, or revise the estimator/operator.

## Wave 19 Spinodal-Window Boundary

The spinodal-window diagnostic finds a narrow order-preserving `xi/L` candidate in the opt-in
`conserved_order_spectral_v1` path, but the target seed replicate margin is not robust. The allowed
claim is limited to: a candidate single-grid window exists for the next finite-size replication
pass. It is not a universality, material, RG-closure, or exponent-scaling result.

## Wave 20 Seed-Margin Boundary

The seed-margin diagnostic repairs the Wave 19 seed robustness blocker for the single-grid target
window by extending relaxation to `4000` steps. The allowed claim is limited to: the `L=16`
spinodal-window target now has enough seed-margin to justify finite-size replication. It is not
yet exponent scaling, material validation, RG closure, or universal phase-transition evidence.

## Wave 21 Finite-Size Replication Boundary

The finite-size replication diagnostic shows that the Wave 20 target is not robust across all
tested grid/seed combinations. Smaller grids pass, but `L=16` fresh seeds fall below the declared
`xi/L` threshold in two of three cases. The allowed claim is limited to: the current finite-size
window still needs redesign or estimator repair before exponent, material, RG, or universality
claims can be tested.

## Wave 22 L16 Relaxation-Repair Boundary

The `L=16` relaxation-repair diagnostic shows that longer single-grid runs are not enough to fix
the fresh-seed `xi/L` margin. Order amplitude increases with step count, but the pass fraction
stays `1/3` through `5600` steps. The allowed claim is limited to: relaxation-only repair is
blocked, so the next wave should adjust the estimator, finite-size window, or scaling design.

## Wave 23 L16 Estimator-Sensitivity Boundary

The estimator-sensitivity diagnostic shows that the Wave 22 `L=16` blocker is controlled by the
axis-autocorrelation crossing threshold. The default `e^-1` threshold exactly reproduces the
blocked result, while lower thresholds (`0.30`, `0.25`, `0.20`) make all 9 fresh-seed cases pass
without max-radius saturation. The allowed claim is limited to: the current `xi/L` gate needs
estimator derivation/calibration or replacement before any non-default threshold can support
finite-size, exponent, material, RG, or universality claims.

## Wave 24 L16 Structure-Factor Estimator Boundary

The structure-factor diagnostic adds a threshold-free characteristic-length proxy to the same
`L=16` fresh-seed fields. It confirms that the fields contain long-wavelength structure, but it
also flags finite-size/domain-scale risk: structure-factor `xi/L` ranges from `0.5549` to
`0.5799` on a single grid. The allowed claim is limited to: a candidate estimator exists for the
next multi-grid calibration wave. It is not an accepted critical correlation length, exponent
result, material validation, RG closure, or universality-class proof.

## Wave 25 Structure-Factor Multi-Grid Boundary

The multi-grid calibration diagnostic confirms that the Wave 24 structure-factor margin is
replicable, but this makes the limitation sharper rather than promoting the claim. Across
`L=8,12,16` and two seed sets, the estimator passes `18/18` cases while sitting near the domain
scale, with median `xi/L` decreasing from `0.997` to `0.566` as grid size increases. The allowed
claim is limited to: the current structure-factor RMS proxy is a reproducible long-wavelength
diagnostic that still needs larger-grid/source-backed calibration before finite-size, exponent,
material, RG, or universality claims.

## Wave 26 L20 Structure-Factor Probe Boundary

The L20 larger-grid probe narrows the Wave 25 blocker but does not clear it. The L20 cases
all pass the structure-factor margin and the median `xi/L` drops to `0.4347`, below the prior
domain-scale warning threshold. However, the absolute structure-factor length does not grow
with the grid (`L20/L16 = 0.9599`), the four-grid log slope is only `0.1110`, the prior L8
median remains domain-scale (`0.9972`), and the structure-factor/axis-lower estimator ratio
is `2.6261`. The allowed claim is limited to: the larger-grid symptom improved, but the
estimator still needs a source-backed or derived admissibility rule before finite-size,
exponent, material, RG, or universality claims.

## Wave 27 Acceptance-Rule Boundary

The acceptance-rule preflight turns the Wave 26 missing-rule blocker into explicit machine
checks. A candidate admissible subset (`L=12,16,20`) exists, but the full current chain still
fails the preflight because `L=8` is domain-scale, absolute `xi_sf` drops from `L=16` to `L=20`,
and the structure-factor/axis-lower estimator disagreement has no reconciliation rule. The
allowed claim is limited to: a conservative preflight rule exists and blocks exponent use of
the current estimator evidence. It is not an accepted critical length or universality result.

## Wave 28 Estimator-Reconciliation Boundary

The estimator-reconciliation gate shows the structure-factor/axis-lower ratio is stable enough
to study as a calibration-gap candidate (`2.6849` at L16, `2.6261` at L20; drift `0.0219`).
That does not accept the factor: the observed calibration remains source-free, the raw ratio
exceeds the unreconciled-ratio ceiling, and both estimators show declining absolute length from
L16 to L20. The allowed claim is limited to: disagreement is structured, not solved.

## Wave 29 Calibration Source-Support Boundary

The source-support gate checks whether the local reference package can justify accepting the
observed calibration factor or current RMS inverse-k proxy. It cannot: local text metadata has
zero matches for structure-factor, second-moment correlation length, Fourier estimator
definition, or finite-size admissibility. External primary candidates are recorded only as
candidates until packaged with formula roles and claim boundaries.

## Wave 30 Source-Manifest Boundary

The source-manifest gate packages three primary-source candidates with DOI/URL, formula role,
and claim boundary. This repairs metadata organization only. It keeps formula extraction,
local full-text support, and calibration acceptance blocked, so the current RMS inverse-k proxy
remains diagnostic-only.

## Wave 31 Formula-Boundary

The formula-boundary gate extracts the source-family second-moment estimator relation as a
zero-mode to lowest-nonzero-mode ratio with a lattice finite-difference denominator. The
current topic proxy instead uses all nonzero Fourier modes and a `2*pi / RMS-k` length.
Therefore the current proxy is rejected for source-backed exponent or calibration use until a
lowest-mode estimator candidate is implemented, compared, and passed through acceptance gates.

## Wave 32 Lowest-Mode Candidate Boundary

The lowest-mode candidate gate implements the source-family relation on the existing L16 and
L20 conserved-order fields. The implementation path passes, but the observable path blocks:
the raw snapshot zero mode is not larger than the lowest nonzero mode in any tested case
(`0/15` valid), so the current single-snapshot lane cannot supply the required susceptibility
observable. No surrogate `S(0)` is accepted by this wave.

## Wave 33 Ensemble Susceptibility-Lane Boundary

The susceptibility-lane gate separates two possible `S(0)` meanings. The source-closer
ensemble magnetization lane `N Var_ensemble(mean(C))` remains invalid for the comparable
L16/L20 groups because conserved mean fluctuations are too small relative to `S(k_min)`.
The spatial-variance proxy produces numeric lengths, but it aggregates nonzero modes and is
not accepted as source-equivalent zero-mode susceptibility without a separate source-backed
policy.

## Wave 34 Estimator-Policy Source Boundary

The policy-source gate makes the next requirements explicit: either package source support
for conserved-order/fixed-composition susceptibility, package source support for a finite-k or
canonical estimator policy, or choose window/dynamics repair without treating an estimator as
accepted. The current source package does not accept either replacement path, and the spatial
variance proxy remains diagnostic-only.

## Wave 35 Policy Source-Candidate Boundary

The source-candidate gate packages fixed-magnetization/canonical ensemble and Cahn-Hilliard
structure-factor source candidates. This is source packaging, not formula acceptance. The
current blocker is now formula extraction and normalization mapping: no candidate source has
been extracted into an accepted conserved-order `S(0)` policy, finite-k estimator, calibration
factor, or finite-size admissibility rule for exponent gates.

## Wave 36 Policy Formula-Boundary

The formula-boundary gate extracts only conservative source boundaries. Fixed-magnetization
and canonical finite-size sources warn that finite systems under conserved constraints cannot
silently supply a canonical zero-mode susceptibility. The Cahn-Hilliard source supports a
finite-k/domain-size review lane, but not an accepted critical `xi_2nd` replacement. Full-text
formula extraction and UET normalization mapping remain open before any exponent gate can rerun.

## Wave 37 Full-Text Formula Readiness

The readiness gate records that rendered or abstract source access is enough to preserve claim
boundaries but not enough to accept formulas. The next acceptable formula path requires local
TeX/PDF math source extraction, exact formula capture, UET lattice normalization mapping, and
finite-size admissibility rules before any estimator replacement or exponent rerun.
