> Ising/liquid-gas beta critical exponent and contains normalized spectral Cahn-Hilliard
> phase-separation simulations. It does not yet establish a full renormalization-group
> derivation or universal phase-transition theory.

## Current Claim Boundary

The primary verifier compares the current UET beta-exponent projection against a topic-local
3D Ising/liquid-gas benchmark. The Cahn-Hilliard solver and order-parameter proof scripts are
mechanism diagnostics until their nondimensional units, seeds, morphology metrics, and material
baselines are locked.

## Current Limitations

- The primary benchmark currently tests beta only, not the full critical-exponent set.
- The Cahn-Hilliard solver is normalized and not yet calibrated to a material dataset.
- Order-parameter thresholds are internal diagnostics.
- Upstream provenance for critical-exponent and critical-point tables still needs a stronger
  external data cache.
- Topic-level source-evidence and branch-claim gates cap the topic at selected-benchmark and mechanism-diagnostic status.
- The artifact-level `phase_transition_claim_scope_gate` must stay `WARN` even when the beta
  benchmark passes, until full exponent/scaling checks, material critical-point gates, and
  renormalization-group closure are source-backed.
- The Wave 5 `spatial_coupled_v1` candidate currently remains diagnostic-only: engine and spatial-operator gates pass, but `universality_shift_gate` is `BLOCKED` with beta still near mean-field.
- The Wave 6 coefficient sensitivity diagnostic found no tested coefficient-only case near the 3D Ising beta target; the next blocker is operator-form or estimator revision, not simple coefficient tuning.
- The Wave 7 correlation-length diagnostic shows the current synthetic window does not expose critical correlation growth (`xi_near/xi_far` about `1.07`, `nu_proxy` about `0.03`), so beta-only fits must not be used for universality promotion.
- The Wave 8 finite-size diagnostic uses three grid sizes and finds Binder-style proxy coverage, but near-critical `xi/L` remains too small (`<= 0.1045`) and the spatial lane does not separate from baseline.
- The Wave 9 critical-window relaxation diagnostic moved closer to `Tc` and increased steps to `2800`, but spatial `xi/L` stayed near `0.07` and did not separate from baseline.
- The Wave 10 operator-form requirement gate aggregates Waves 5-9 and keeps `operator_form_requirement_gate == BLOCKED`; any `spatial_coupled_v2` path must add a nonlocal, conserved, or scale-dependent mechanism and pass correlation/separation gates before claim promotion.
- The Wave 11 `spatial_coupled_v2` candidate adds screened nonlocal memory and a conserved interface/game drive in core mode, but its first diagnostic remains `WARN`: core/safety/stability gates pass while `v2_correlation_response_gate` and `v2_operator_separation_gate` are `BLOCKED` (`max_xi/L = 0.0733`).
- The Wave 12 component ablation keeps the v2 family diagnostic-only: coverage and force-lane isolation pass, but every tested v2 component profile stays below baseline `xi/L`; the best profile is `v2_memory_long` with improvement `-0.0038`.
- The Wave 13 Model C diagnostic uses the topic Cahn-Hilliard engine and passes mechanism gates: mass drift is `~2.1e-16`, median Model C `xi` growth is `30.49`, and the lane separates from the nonconserved comparison by `5.81` in median `xi`-growth ratio. This is a repair direction, not a universality proof.
- The Wave 14 `conserved_order_v1` core candidate exposes Model C-style conserved flow as an opt-in core mode and preserves legacy defaults/mass conservation, but its explicit finite-difference mechanism response is still blocked: core conserved median `xi` growth is `0.87` versus legacy core `1.47`.
- The Wave 15 numerics-gap diagnostic shows the explicit core path is not a viable direct replacement under Wave 13-like settings: the explicit stiffness proxy is `32685` for the spectral reference settings versus `0.097` for the Wave 14 core candidate, so the next core candidate should be spectral or semi-implicit rather than mobility-only tuning.
- The Wave 16 `conserved_order_spectral_v1` core candidate repairs that implementation gap under Wave 13-like settings: all core bridge gates pass, max topic-engine field delta is `2.89e-12`, and median `xi` growth matches the topic spectral engine at `30.49`; this opens the next scaling verifier but does not upgrade universality claims.
- The Wave 17 finite-size/exponent diagnostic keeps the spectral core candidate diagnostic-only: coverage, stability, and Binder-style proxy gates pass, but max near-critical `xi/L` is only `0.145` and median beta is `1.77`, so correlation-window and universality-exponent gates remain blocked.
- The Wave 18 window-repair diagnostic shows longer relaxation/window tweaks still fail (`max xi/L = 0.113`), while kappa can lift `xi/L` to `0.377` only with low order signal (`0.000377`), so smoothing-like parameter tradeoffs must not be promoted as scaling evidence.
- The Wave 19 spinodal-window diagnostic finds one order-preserving `xi/L` pass (`xi/L = 0.204`, order `0.0126`) at `T = 0.900`, `kappa = 0.100`, and `2400` steps, but the target seed replicate pass fraction is only `0.25` and median replicate `xi/L` is `0.1965`, so the next blocker is seed-margin and finite-size replication, not claim promotion.
- The Wave 20 seed-margin diagnostic repairs that single-grid seed margin at `T = 0.900`, `kappa = 0.100`, and `4000` steps: target pass fraction is `1.0`, min `xi/L` is `0.2004`, and min order is `0.0505`, but `finite_size_replication_gate` remains `BLOCKED`.
- The Wave 21 finite-size replication diagnostic keeps the window diagnostic-only: `L=8` and `L=12` pass across tested seed sets, but `L=16` fresh seeds pass only `1/3` and drop to min `xi/L = 0.1944`, so grid replication and seed-set generalization remain blocked.
- The Wave 22 `L=16` relaxation-repair diagnostic shows longer runs at `4800` and `5600` steps increase order amplitude but still pass only `1/3` fresh seeds; min `xi/L` remains below threshold (`0.1938` to `0.1950`), so relaxation-only repair is blocked.
- The Wave 23 estimator-sensitivity diagnostic reproduces the default `e^-1` blocker exactly, but lower axis-autocorrelation thresholds (`0.30`, `0.25`, `0.20`) make all 9 L16 fresh-seed cases pass without saturation; this narrows the controller to estimator derivation/calibration, not claim promotion.
- The Wave 24 structure-factor diagnostic adds a threshold-free RMS length proxy: it passes the L16 margin in `9/9` cases with min `xi/L = 0.5549`, but `domain_scale_guard == WARN` because the single-grid length is near the domain scale, so multi-grid calibration is now the controller.
- The Wave 25 multi-grid calibration confirms the structure-factor margin replicates across `L=8,12,16` and both seed sets (`18/18` passes), but `domain_scale_calibration_gate == BLOCKED`: median `xi/L` is `0.997` at `L=8`, `0.717` at `L=12`, and `0.566` at `L=16`, so the estimator remains domain-scale saturated.
- The Wave 26 L20 probe passes stability and L20 margin gates (`6/6` cases, median `xi/L = 0.4347`), but `derived_acceptance_rule_gate == BLOCKED`: the L20 absolute `xi` is slightly below L16 (`L20/L16 = 0.9599`), prior L8 remains domain-scale, and structure-factor/axis-estimator reconciliation still lacks an admissibility rule.
- The Wave 27 acceptance preflight defines the missing rule but does not clear it: candidate grids `L=12,16,20` exist, while `L=8` is excluded, `absolute_length_consistency_gate == BLOCKED`, and `estimator_reconciliation_gate == BLOCKED`.
- The Wave 28 reconciliation gate finds the structure-factor/axis-lower ratio is stable (`2.6849` at L16 and `2.6261` at L20), but calibration remains unaccepted and both axis-lower and structure-factor absolute lengths decline from L16 to L20.
- The Wave 29 source-support gate finds zero local text-source matches for structure-factor, second-moment correlation length, Fourier estimator definition, or finite-size admissibility, so calibration acceptance is blocked until primary estimator sources are packaged.
- The Wave 30 source-manifest gate packages three primary-source candidates and passes metadata coverage, but `local_formula_extraction_gate` and `calibration_acceptance_gate` remain `BLOCKED`.
- The Wave 31 formula-boundary gate extracts the source-family second-moment estimator boundary, but `current_proxy_source_match_gate` remains `BLOCKED` because the current RMS inverse-k proxy does not match the source-backed lowest-mode relation.
- The Wave 32 lowest-mode candidate gate implements the source-family estimator, but `lowest_mode_observable_gate` is `BLOCKED`: all `15/15` current snapshot cases are invalid because raw `S(0)` is not larger than `S(k_min)`.
- The Wave 33 susceptibility-lane gate separates ensemble magnetization `S(0)` from spatial-variance proxy: raw ensemble `S(0)` is blocked by conserved-mean constraints, while spatial variance is diagnostic-only and not source-equivalent.
- The Wave 34 estimator-policy source gate defines three policy paths, but both source-backed replacement paths remain `BLOCKED`; spatial variance stays diagnostic-only.
- The Wave 35 source-candidate gate packages fixed-magnetization/canonical and Cahn-Hilliard structure-factor source candidates, but formula extraction and accepted estimator policy remain `BLOCKED`.
- The Wave 36 formula-boundary gate extracts conservative source boundaries, but full-text formula extraction, UET normalization mapping, and accepted estimator policy remain `BLOCKED`.
- The Wave 37 readiness gate records rendered/abstract source access but blocks formula acceptance until local TeX/PDF math sources are localized and mapped.
- The Wave 38 localization gate verifies temporary arXiv source archives and main TeX members, but formula extraction, repo archival policy, and estimator acceptance remain blocked or warning-level.
- Wave 43 preserves 19 TeX formula fragments across the fixed-magnetization, canonical finite-size, and Cahn-Hilliard structure-factor source lanes, but the current rerun finds the temporary source cache missing; source refresh/provenance, accepted estimator policy, and UET normalization mapping remain blocked.
- Wave 44 records the repo archive policy and candidate paths under `docs/data/external/condensed_matter/phase_transitions/structure_factor_sources`; `repo_archive_availability_gate == PASS` after restoring all three arXiv source archives to repo paths; `temporary_cache_availability_gate` remains `BLOCKED`, and estimator-policy/UET normalization mapping remains blocked.
- Wave 46 maps the restored formula fragments to estimator-policy lanes. The Cahn-Hilliard finite-k structure-factor source lane is now the clearest candidate path, but `uet_normalization_mapping_gate`, `finite_size_admissibility_gate`, and `estimator_policy_acceptance_gate` remain `BLOCKED`.
- Wave 47 writes the Cahn-Hilliard finite-k normalization preflight. `fourier_convention_gate == PASS`, but `field_normalization_gate == WARN` and coefficient mapping, xi extraction, admissibility, implementation, and estimator acceptance remain `BLOCKED`.
- Wave 48 implements a source-linked Cahn-Hilliard finite-k peak estimator candidate on existing conserved-order fields. Implementation, source-linkage, q-window diagnostics, domain-scale guard, and finite-size trend gates pass, but coefficient policy and estimator acceptance remain `BLOCKED`; median `xi/L` is `0.5` and pass fraction is `12/18`.
- Wave 49 defines the strict acceptance policy for that candidate. `wave48_chain_gate`, `acceptance_policy_manifest_gate`, `coefficient_exclusion_policy_gate`, and `low_window_edge_policy_gate` pass, but `accepted_row_coverage_gate`, `source_dynamics_coefficient_mapping_gate`, `estimator_acceptance_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain `BLOCKED`; accepted rows are `6/18` and only cover `L20`.
- Wave 50 probes larger grids under the unchanged Wave 49 policy. `accepted_multi_grid_coverage_gate == PASS` with accepted grid counts `L20:6`, `L24:2`, and `L28:2`, but `field_normalization_policy_gate == WARN`, while `source_dynamics_coefficient_mapping_gate`, `estimator_acceptance_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain `BLOCKED`.
- Wave 51 separates the finite-k measurement lane from source-dynamics claims. `diagnostic_measurement_lane_gate`, `measurement_field_centering_gate`, and `measurement_only_coefficient_exclusion_gate` pass, but `source_equivalent_field_normalization_gate`, `accepted_estimator_replacement_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain `BLOCKED`.
- Wave 52 decides field-normalization readiness: source field symbols and centered-C proxy use pass for diagnostics, but `amplitude_normalization_gate`, `averaging_convention_gate`, `accepted_estimator_replacement_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain `BLOCKED`.
- Wave 53 separates shape-only q-peak diagnostics from source-amplitude claims. `q_peak_amplitude_invariance_gate`, `diagnostic_seed_aggregation_gate`, and `shape_only_diagnostic_lane_gate` pass, but `source_amplitude_normalization_gate`, `source_averaging_convention_gate`, `source_equivalent_estimator_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain `BLOCKED`.
- Wave 54 defines the source averaging/uncertainty preflight. `diagnostic_seed_aggregation_gate == PASS`, but `claim_bearing_replicate_gate`, `source_time_averaging_gate`, `uncertainty_interval_policy_gate`, `source_equivalent_estimator_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain `BLOCKED`.
- Wave 55 selects replicate/temporal acquisition as the next controller. `wave54_chain_gate`, `replicate_temporal_acquisition_plan_gate`, and `selected_next_path_gate` pass, while replacement-observable availability, estimator acceptance, exponent rerun, and next-path execution remain `BLOCKED`.
