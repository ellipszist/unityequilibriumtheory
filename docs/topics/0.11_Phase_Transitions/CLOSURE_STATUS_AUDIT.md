# 0.11 Closure Status Audit

**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Scope:** 0.11 Phase Transitions
**Audit type:** status reconstruction and Tier-A closure planning

## Current Answer

Topic 0.11 is important because it is one of the first places where UET tries to move from conceptual equation behavior into a physics benchmark: phase-transition critical behavior.

It is not closed as Tier A right now.

The current controlled status is:

```text
Readiness: Draft
Tier: B
Claim level: selected internal beta benchmark plus diagnostic mechanism lanes
Current controller: execute the CH finite-k replicate/temporal acquisition plan, or accept a source-backed replacement observable, before estimator acceptance and exponent rerun gates
```

This means the topic has useful internal evidence, but it cannot yet claim a full phase-transition theory, RG closure, universal critical behavior, or accepted dynamics-based 3D Ising scaling.

## What Is Already Working

| Lane | What works | Boundary |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Primary beta benchmark | `Research_Critical_Exponents.py` writes a `PASS` artifact for the selected beta comparison. | This is a selected benchmark, not a full exponent-set or RG result. |
| Spatial-coupled operator | Core opt-in spatial modes exist and pass engine/operator availability gates. | Dynamics stayed mean-field-like in the scaling artifact. |
| Conserved-order spectral core | `conserved_order_spectral_v1` repaired the core implementation bridge to the topic Cahn-Hilliard engine. | Later finite-size/exponent gates remained blocked. |
| Structure-factor work | The blocker was narrowed from vague estimator uncertainty to specific formula/source-policy gates. | The accepted estimator formula and normalization mapping are still missing. |

## Why It Still Cannot Close

The blocker is not that nothing works. The blocker is that the claim-bearing scaling path is not yet accepted.

The latest controlling evidence says:

- The primary beta artifact can support only a selected beta-exponent benchmark.
- The dynamics/scaling artifacts still block universality claims.
- The current structure-factor RMS proxy is diagnostic-only and rejected as a source-backed second-moment estimator replacement.
- The source-family lowest-mode estimator implementation exists, but current conserved-order snapshots do not provide an accepted `S(0)` susceptibility observable.
- Policy-source candidates, exact TeX fragments, repo source archives, and a formula-to-policy normalization map are now packaged, but UET normalization mapping, finite-size admissibility, and estimator acceptance remain blocked.
- The latest source and formula gates restore repo archives and fresh formula extraction, then map those fragments to policy lanes; they still do not accept UET normalization, finite-size admissibility, or estimator replacement.
- Wave 49 defines strict finite-k acceptance policy, but only `6/18` rows survive and all accepted rows are at `L20`; accepted-row coverage, source coefficient mapping, estimator acceptance, and exponent rerun gates remain blocked.
- Wave 50 probes larger grids under the same policy and repairs accepted-row coverage as a probe (`L20:6`, `L24:2`, `L28:2`), but field normalization, source coefficient mapping, estimator acceptance, and exponent rerun gates remain blocked.
- Wave 51 separates measurement-only coefficient exclusion from source-dynamics claims: diagnostic finite-k measurement can proceed as a bounded lane, but source-equivalent field normalization, estimator replacement, and exponent rerun remain blocked.
- Wave 52 narrows the field-normalization blocker: source field symbols and centered-C proxy use pass diagnostically, but amplitude/variance normalization, averaging convention, estimator replacement, and exponent rerun remain blocked.
- Wave 53 separates shape-only q-peak diagnostics from source-amplitude claims: amplitude-invariant q-peak measurement and diagnostic seed aggregation pass, but source amplitude, source averaging/uncertainty, estimator replacement, and exponent rerun remain blocked.
- Wave 54 keeps current rows diagnostic-only for uncertainty: diagnostic seed aggregation passes, but claim-bearing replicate count, source time averaging, uncertainty interval policy, estimator replacement, and exponent rerun remain blocked.
- Wave 55 selects replicate/temporal acquisition as the next controller because no replacement observable policy is accepted. Plan definition passes, but acquisition execution, estimator acceptance, and exponent rerun remain blocked.

## Current Machine-Readable Gate

The audit gate is saved at:

```text
Result/artifacts/0_11_closure_status_audit.json
```

The gate keeps the topic at `WARN` with:

```text
tier_a_closure_gate = BLOCKED
primary_beta_gate = PASS
scaling_claim_gate = BLOCKED
estimator_formula_gate = BLOCKED
source_archive_policy_gate = PASS
ch_finite_k_acceptance_policy_gate = WARN
accepted_row_coverage_gate = PASS_IN_WAVE50_PROBE
estimator_normalization_map_gate = WARN
ch_finite_k_next_path_decision_gate = WARN
```

## Drift Found

The main documentation drift is in the tail of `UPDATE_LOG.md`.

Wave 39-41 wording says the topic is formally verified at the analytical projection level. That wording is not supported by the current topic index, verification spec, formula audit, or latest estimator/source gates. Treat those entries as historical notes that require claim-boundary correction, not as the current topic status.

The current controlling status remains the artifact/gate chain, especially the Wave 55 next-path decision artifact and this closure audit.

## Path To Tier A

Tier A should require a narrow, explicit closure route:

1. Execute the selected replicate/temporal acquisition plan by adding at least two accepted L24 rows and two accepted L28 rows under the unchanged strict policy, or accept a source-backed replacement observable.
2. Record an explicit time-window or multi-snapshot ensemble averaging rule for claim-bearing `S(q,t)` rows.
3. Define row-level, grid-level, and fit-level uncertainty propagation before estimator acceptance.
4. Accept or reject source `S(q)` amplitude/susceptibility normalization separately from shape-only `q_peak` diagnostics.
5. Rerun finite-size/exponent gates only after estimator acceptance and all selected-path evidence gates pass.
6. Require at least beta, nu/correlation-length behavior, finite-size consistency, and baseline separation before any dynamics-based universality claim.
7. Keep material critical-point calibration and RG closure as separate gates; do not smuggle them into a beta-only pass.
8. Only after the artifact chain passes should README/topic index wording move toward Tier A, and that promotion still needs human review.

## Safe Claim Boundary

Allowed now:

```text
Topic 0.11 has a passing internal selected-beta benchmark and several diagnostic operator/source-formula lanes. Wave 55 selects replicate/temporal acquisition as the next hardening path because no replacement observable is accepted. The plan is defined but not executed, and the topic is not closed.
```

Not allowed now:

```text
UET has solved phase transitions.
Topic 0.11 is verified as a full theory.
The current engine proves a 3D Ising universality shift.
The analytical beta projection alone closes the topic as Tier A.
```

## Wave 43 Update

Wave 43 narrows the formula-source blocker. The project now has `structure_factor_tex_formula_fragments.json` and `0_11_structure_factor_tex_formula_fragment_gate.json`, with 19 formula fragments preserved from the three localized source lanes. The current rerun reports the temporary source cache missing, so source-cache reproducibility is now part of the controller.

This does not close Tier A. The current controller moves to:

```text
restore_or_archive_sources_then_map_estimator_policy
```

Required next evidence: reacquired or repo-archived source archives with expected hashes, accepted estimator policy, UET normalization mapping, and finite-size admissibility before exponent or universality gates rerun.

## Wave 44 Update

Wave 44 adds `structure_factor_source_archive_policy.json` and `0_11_structure_factor_source_archive_policy_gate.json`. The policy manifest records the three arXiv e-print URLs, expected hashes, and candidate repo archive paths. `formula_fragment_preservation_gate == PASS`, `source_archive_policy_manifest_gate == PASS`, and `repo_archive_availability_gate == PASS` with `3/3` archives restored. The next controller is estimator-policy acceptance and UET-normalization mapping.

## Wave 46 Update

Wave 46 adds `structure_factor_estimator_normalization_map.json` and `0_11_structure_factor_estimator_normalization_map_gate.json`. The gate maps the restored formula fragments to fixed-magnetization, canonical finite-size, and Cahn-Hilliard finite-k policy lanes. `wave43_chain_gate`, `wave44_archive_gate`, `fragment_coverage_gate`, and `policy_mapping_manifest_gate` pass. The Cahn-Hilliard finite-k lane is the strongest candidate family, but `uet_normalization_mapping_gate`, `finite_size_admissibility_gate`, and `estimator_policy_acceptance_gate` remain blocked.

## Wave 47 Update

Wave 47 adds `structure_factor_ch_finite_k_normalization_preflight.json` and `0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_normalization_preflight_gate.json`. The gate keeps the Wave 46 CH finite-k candidate path but splits the normalization blocker into concrete sub-gates: `fourier_convention_gate == PASS`, `field_normalization_gate == WARN`, and `coefficient_mapping_gate`, `xi_extraction_rule_gate`, `finite_size_admissibility_gate`, `implementation_acceptance_gate`, and `estimator_acceptance_preflight_gate` remain `BLOCKED`. The next controller is a source-backed CH finite-k estimator implementation verifier with q-window diagnostics.

## Wave 48 Update

Wave 48 adds `0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_estimator_candidate_gate.json` and `gl_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_estimator_candidate_stats.csv`. The verifier implements a source-linked CH finite-k peak estimator candidate using centered UET `C` and the Wave 47 q-grid convention. `wave47_chain_gate`, `source_formula_linkage_gate`, `implementation_coverage_gate`, `q_window_diagnostic_gate`, `domain_scale_guard_gate`, and `finite_size_trend_gate` pass. `coefficient_policy_gate` and `estimator_acceptance_gate` remain blocked. The next controller is estimator acceptance policy: field normalization, source coefficient inclusion/exclusion, q-window acceptance thresholds, and a finite-size/exponent rerun using only accepted rows.


## Wave 49 Update

Wave 49 adds `Data/03_Research/structure_factor_ch_finite_k_acceptance_policy.json` and `Result/artifacts/0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_acceptance_policy_gate.json`. The gate defines strict row policy for the Wave 48 CH finite-k candidate and keeps measurement-only `S(q)` diagnostics separate from source dynamics coefficient claims. `wave48_chain_gate`, `acceptance_policy_manifest_gate`, `coefficient_exclusion_policy_gate`, and `low_window_edge_policy_gate` pass. `field_normalization_policy_gate == WARN`, while `accepted_row_coverage_gate`, `source_dynamics_coefficient_mapping_gate`, `estimator_acceptance_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain blocked. Strict policy accepts only `6/18` rows and only the `L20` grid, so no finite-size/exponent rerun is allowed yet.


## Wave 50 Update

Wave 50 adds `Result/artifacts/0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_extended_grid_coverage_probe.json` and `Result/gl_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_extended_grid_coverage_probe_stats.csv`. The probe applies the unchanged Wave 49 strict policy to `L24` and `L28` rows and combines them with prior accepted `L20` rows. `wave49_chain_gate`, `extended_grid_probe_gate`, `policy_application_gate`, and `accepted_multi_grid_coverage_gate` pass; accepted grid counts are `L20:6`, `L24:2`, and `L28:2`. This repairs the row-coverage blocker only as a probe. `field_normalization_policy_gate == WARN`, while `source_dynamics_coefficient_mapping_gate`, `estimator_acceptance_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain blocked.

## Wave 51 Update

Wave 51 adds `Data/03_Research/structure_factor_ch_finite_k_field_coefficient_policy.json` and `Result/artifacts/0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_field_coefficient_policy_gate.json`. The gate preserves Wave 50 accepted-row coverage as a diagnostic measurement lane and separates coefficient policy by claim type. `wave50_chain_gate`, `measurement_field_centering_gate`, `measurement_only_coefficient_exclusion_gate`, and `diagnostic_measurement_lane_gate` pass. `source_equivalent_field_normalization_gate`, `accepted_estimator_replacement_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain blocked; source dynamics coefficients remain blocked for source-dynamics/material claims.

## Wave 52 Update

Wave 52 adds `Data/03_Research/structure_factor_ch_finite_k_field_normalization_decision.json` and `Result/artifacts/0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_field_normalization_decision_gate.json`. The gate audits source field symbols and centered-UET-`C` mapping. `wave51_chain_gate`, `source_field_symbol_gate`, `uet_centered_field_proxy_gate`, and `diagnostic_measurement_lane_gate` pass. `amplitude_normalization_gate`, `averaging_convention_gate`, `source_equivalent_field_acceptance_gate`, `accepted_estimator_replacement_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain blocked.

## Wave 53 Update

Wave 53 adds `Data/03_Research/structure_factor_ch_finite_k_shape_only_normalization_policy.json` and `Result/artifacts/0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_shape_only_normalization_policy_gate.json`. The gate records amplitude-invariant finite-k peak-location policy. `wave52_chain_gate`, `q_peak_amplitude_invariance_gate`, `diagnostic_seed_aggregation_gate`, and `shape_only_diagnostic_lane_gate` pass. `source_amplitude_normalization_gate`, `source_averaging_convention_gate`, `source_equivalent_estimator_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain blocked.

## Wave 54 Update

Wave 54 adds `Data/03_Research/structure_factor_ch_finite_k_source_averaging_uncertainty_policy.json` and `Result/artifacts/0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_source_averaging_uncertainty_gate.json`. The gate preserves diagnostic seed aggregation while blocking claim-bearing uncertainty. `wave53_chain_gate` and `diagnostic_seed_aggregation_gate` pass. `claim_bearing_replicate_gate`, `source_time_averaging_gate`, `uncertainty_interval_policy_gate`, `source_equivalent_estimator_gate`, and `exponent_rerun_gate` remain blocked.

## Wave 55 Update

Wave 55 adds `Data/03_Research/structure_factor_ch_finite_k_next_path_decision.json` and `Result/artifacts/0_11_structure_factor_ch_finite_k_next_path_decision_gate.json`. `wave54_chain_gate`, `replicate_temporal_acquisition_plan_gate`, and `selected_next_path_gate` pass. `replacement_observable_available_gate`, `estimator_acceptance_gate`, `exponent_rerun_gate`, and `next_path_gate` remain blocked. The selected controller is execution of the replicate/temporal acquisition plan, not claim promotion.
