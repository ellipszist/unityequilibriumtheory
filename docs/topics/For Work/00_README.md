# UET Standards Workspace

This folder is the permanent operating standard for UET topic work.

It is not a theory manifesto. It is the place that defines how research work is organized,
reviewed, written, and promoted so the repo stays systematic, auditable, reproducible, and
scientifically legible.

## Purpose

Use this workspace as the first-stop operating manual whenever a topic is being created,
rewritten, audited, or prepared for paper conversion.

## When to use

Use this folder when you need to:

- create a new topic with the correct folder pattern
- repair credibility, evidence, or claim inflation problems
- standardize code, data, references, results, or manuscripts
- onboard a human or AI collaborator into the repo workflow
- decide what document to open next for a specific task

## Key rules

- No topic is allowed to outrun its evidence.
- A fit must stay a fit until out-of-sample support exists.
- Internal benchmarks must stay labeled as internal benchmarks.
- Every practical workflow should point to commands, inputs, and outputs.
- Every standards page should be easy to scan, not just correct in prose.
- Every important formula must declare origin, units, and proof status.
- Repository prose must not be promoted from dictation alone; it must be tied to a derivation, script, artifact, or source record.
- Every topic README must include at least one conceptual diagram and one evidence/status matrix so later readers can understand the theory role, data path, formula status, verifier role, and limitations without reading the whole folder first.
- Scientific hardening should strengthen the research argument by exposing dependencies, mechanisms, tests, and blockers; it must not collapse the topic into only defensive wording.
- Multi-wave work should use a standard update log when a reader would otherwise need to reconstruct progress from diffs alone.
- Repeated hardening work should start from a generated research wave packet before rereading a whole topic folder.

## Common failure modes

- governance documents exist but nobody knows reading order
- topic standards are written, but folder naming is still inconsistent
- commands are missing from practical guides, so reruns stop being easy
- diagrams disappear during cleanup, so the docs become harder to navigate
- AI rewrites prose upward without an evidence-based status review
- AI rewrites prose downward without adding diagrams, formula maps, verifier links, or clearer theory structure

## Checklist

- [ ] numbering scheme is used consistently across this folder
- [ ] reading order is clear for common work modes
- [ ] every main standard links to the correct renamed files
- [ ] practical guides contain commands only where they help real execution
- [ ] diagrams and tables exist to support fast scanning
- [ ] topic README templates require a conceptual diagram and evidence/status matrix
