# UET Book Writing Workflow

This is the shared workflow for long-form non-fiction and theory books. It
keeps each book's voice and structure intact while standardizing research,
review, version, and publication boundaries.

## Core rule

The book's style is local to the book. The workflow is shared.

Every active book separates:

- blueprint and intended structure
- reference planning and source digest
- manuscript draft
- review result for each wave
- public publication boundary

An elegant paragraph is not evidence that its source, claim, or publication
status has been checked.

## What this standard controls

This document standardizes the work system, not the book's voice. It controls
research design, evidence records, manuscript versions, review roles, change
traceability, and the boundary between a working draft and a public release.

There is no single ISO-style global workflow that fits every book. This standard
combines common professional distinctions from research writing, fact-checking,
editorial work, copyediting, proofreading, permissions, and publishing. Each book
may adapt the depth, but it must declare the adaptation and keep the same evidence
and handoff logic.

## Operating principles

1. Start with a research question, audience, and claim boundary.
2. Treat the first blueprint as provisional until the literature review changes or confirms it.
3. Separate a source that was planned, located, read, appraised, and actually used.
4. Map important claims to evidence before polishing the prose.
5. Keep one canonical working manuscript and make every material change traceable.
6. Never let layout, a polished tone, or an AI draft upgrade the evidence status of a claim.
7. Every gate must have an artifact, an owner, a pass condition, and a next controller.

## Section and volume architecture

When a project contains a Section made of three books, use a parent-child workflow. The Section is the parent narrative and research architecture; each book is a child volume; chapters or episodes are the units inside a book.

```text
SECTION BLUEPRINT
  -> BOOK 1 BLUEPRINT
       -> chapter / episode units
  -> BOOK 2 BLUEPRINT
       -> chapter / episode units
  -> BOOK 3 BLUEPRINT
       -> chapter / episode units
```

Use the project profile THREE_BOOK_SECTION when the Section must contain exactly three books. The workflow remains reusable for another declared volume count, but the number of volumes must be explicit in the Section manifest.

The Section blueprint answers: why these books belong together, what the complete reader journey is, what role each book plays, what each book may own or defer, and how evidence, concepts, terms, chronology, and unresolved questions move between books.

The Book blueprint answers: what this individual book promises, what it must establish, which chapters or episodes deliver that promise, which claims and sources it owns, what it receives from the Section or prior books, and what it hands off to the next book.

### Section control package

For a Section with three books, maintain one parent control package using existing canonical filenames where the repository already has an equivalent:

```text
SECTION_MANIFEST.json
SECTION_BLUEPRINT.md
SECTION_RESEARCH_DESIGN.md
SECTION_LITERATURE_REVIEW.md
SECTION_CLAIM_MAP.md
VOLUME_MATRIX.md
DEPENDENCY_MAP.md
SHARED_TERMS.md
SECTION_UPDATE_LOG.md
```

The parent package is the source of truth for Section identity, volume count, shared promise, volume roles, cross-book claims, dependencies, handoffs, and Section-level status. It does not replace the local manifest, blueprint, source register, claim map, or update log of each book.

At repository level, `uet_history/3_publish/books/SECTION_REGISTRY.json` maps each Section to its canonical parent path and child volume IDs. The Section manifest and package control Section content and gate state; the Book Registry continues to control individual book identity and publication state.

Human-facing Section paths use concise academic-domain labels. The parent folder shows the grouping, so do not add a visible `section_` prefix or Section number to the parent folder. Child book folders use a numeric volume prefix for reading order, while stable `section_id`, `book_id`, and `volume_number` values remain in registries and manifests; use full English `snake_case` labels for folders.

### Volume control package

Each child book keeps its own canonical book package and records at least:

- book_id
- section_id
- volume_number
- section_blueprint_version
- book promise and reader outcomes
- entry conditions and exit conditions
- chapter or episode IDs
- claim IDs owned by the book
- inputs from the Section or earlier books
- outputs and handoffs to the Section or later books
- local sources, evidence limits, and unresolved questions

### Parent-child invariants

1. The Section promise is the parent boundary. A book may narrow it but must not silently redefine it.
2. In the THREE_BOOK_SECTION profile, the volume matrix must contain exactly Book 1, Book 2, and Book 3 with stable IDs.
3. Every major Section objective or claim has one primary owning book. Supporting books may be listed, but ownership cannot remain ambiguous.
4. Every book chapter or episode maps to a Section role, a book promise, and one or more claim or evidence tasks.
5. Every cross-book dependency has an explicit source, destination, dependency type, and resolution status.
6. Shared terms, concepts, chronology, entities, equations, and recurring examples have one controlled definition or a documented reason for variation.
7. A local book edit may not silently change another book's entry condition, exit condition, role, claim ownership, or handoff.
8. A parent blueprint is not considered locked merely because all three child outlines exist. The parent-child mappings and unresolved items must also pass review.

### Section blueprint lifecycle

Use the same gate states as the book workflow: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, PASS, PASS_WITH_OPEN_ITEMS, BLOCKED, or SUPERSEDED.

### Blueprint field contract

Section Blueprint minimum fields:

- section_id, title, profile, version, status, volume_count, volume_ids
- Section promise, audience, central question, scope, exclusions, and claim boundary
- complete three-book arc and distinct role of each volume
- primary owner for each major claim, objective, concept, event, and evidence family
- shared terms, dependencies, chronology, recurring entities, and handoffs
- research domains, literature-review boundary, source hierarchy, and evidence ceiling
- unresolved questions, controlling blocker, next controller, and change history

Book Blueprint minimum fields:

- book_id, section_id, volume_number, version, status, section_blueprint_version
- book promise, audience, reader outcomes, scope, exclusions, entry state, and exit state
- chapter or episode IDs, purpose, order, dependencies, and expected handoff
- claim IDs owned by the book, evidence class, source needs, counter-evidence, and wording boundary
- inputs received from the Section or earlier books and outputs delivered to later books
- unresolved questions, controlling blocker, next controller, and change history

### Section-to-volume operating sequence

1. Run S00-S03 to establish the Section boundary, research design, literature synthesis, and parent claim map.
2. Run S04-S05 to allocate ownership and make cross-book dependencies visible.
3. Run S06 to draft the three child Book Blueprints.
4. Run S07 to review and lock the parent-child architecture.
5. Run W00-W18 separately for each book. The three book workflows may run in parallel after the parent lock, but each keeps its own evidence and review gates.
6. Run S08 after any change that may cross a book boundary and before declaring the Section coherent.
7. Run S09 only when the Section version, all three book versions, registry records, and public boundaries agree.

## Planning-first agent protocol

The first interaction for a new book-writing task is a planning pass, not a request to choose an episode. The Section and book architecture must be visible before the manuscript is drafted.

When the user asks to start, write, or continue a book and no approved execution plan has been named:

1. Inspect the Section parent package first when the book belongs to a Section. Read the Section Blueprint, research design, literature review, claim map, Volume Matrix, Dependency Map, and current gate state.
2. Inspect the canonical book folder, its Book Blueprint, research design, literature review, source register or digest, claim map, verification specification, and update log when present.
3. Read uet_history/3_publish/books/โครงสร้างหนังสือ.md as the authoritative local writing pattern. This file controls how a chosen unit is written; it does not replace the Section/Book planning pass.
4. Produce and show a planning package before drafting prose:
   - the complete Section arc and the role of all three books, when applicable;
   - the plan for each book, including promise, boundary, reader outcome, chapter or unit map, dependencies, evidence needs, and handoffs;
   - the research and reference tasks mapped to the planned claims or units;
   - the current S00-S09 and W00-W05 state, open decisions, and next controller.
5. Stop for author review and approval of the plan. Do not silently select an episode, invent a chapter, or begin manuscript prose during this planning pass.
6. After the relevant Section/Book plan and blueprint lock are approved, select an execution unit only as a downstream writing task. Apply the local structure exactly, complete the required review, and split into page or layout units only at the local structure's approved stage.

Do not open a new task with "which episode should I write?" or "write episode X" unless the parent plan and the book blueprint are already approved and the user explicitly wants execution of that unit. Use the existing S00-S09 and W00-W18 gates; this protocol changes the order of interaction, not the gate model.

### Reopen and drift rules

- If a Book change affects its role, promise, claim ownership, entry or exit condition, shared term, dependency, chronology, or handoff, reopen S04-S07 before continuing local drafting.
- If a source change affects a shared claim or the Section literature synthesis, reopen S03-S04 and the affected book gates W04, W05, or W10.
- If a change is local to wording, structure, or evidence inside one book and does not affect the parent fields above, keep it inside that Book's W00-W18 workflow and record the Section check as no-impact.
- Never update a child blueprint version without recording the Section Blueprint version it was checked against.
- A published book cannot silently become the new Section architecture. Reopen the Section workflow and create a new parent version when the architecture changes.
## Standard lifecycle

```text
W00 BOOK_INTAKE_AND_BOUNDARY
  -> W01 PROVISIONAL_BLUEPRINT
  -> W02 RESEARCH_DESIGN
  -> W03 LITERATURE_REVIEW
  -> W04 SOURCE_DIGEST_AND_PROVENANCE
  -> W05 CLAIM_MAP_AND_BLUEPRINT_LOCK
  -> W06 DRAFT_1
  -> W07 AUTHOR_REVIEW
  -> W08 DRAFT_2
  -> W09 MANUSCRIPT_INTEGRITY_CHECK

  -> W15 RIGHTS_LEGAL_ETHICS
  -> W16 PAGE_LAYOUT_INDEX_AND_PROOF
  -> W17 PUBLISH_AND_ARCHIVE
  -> W18 POST_PUBLICATION_MAINTENANCE
```

The lifecycle describes process state. It does not mean that every scientific,
medical, historical, or policy claim has been externally validated.

## Per-unit contract

Each book may define its own chapter, episode, section, or page structure. The
shared workflow does not replace or rename that local contract. Record the local
structure in the book's README and blueprint, then use stable chapter/episode
IDs when mapping sources and review results. This per-unit contract applies only
after the Section/Book planning pass and the relevant blueprint lock; it is not
the starting command for a new book.

For every writing unit, the normal order is:

```text
lock the local structure
  -> plan and digest sources
  -> write the unit
  -> author reviews meaning, tone, and intent
  -> revise into the next draft
  -> split into page/layout units when ready
```

Page splitting must not become a second place where unsupported claims are
introduced.

## Reference workflow

Reference work has five distinct passes. They may loop, but they must not be collapsed into one bibliography step.

### 1. Research design

Before collecting a large source list, declare the review question, review mode, scope, search terms, databases or repositories, date and language boundaries, inclusion and exclusion rules, source hierarchy, cutoff date, and known blind spots.

### 2. Literature review

The literature review is a question-led synthesis of the field. It must identify established findings, major positions, methods and assumptions, agreement, controversy, contrary evidence, limitations, gaps, and the relationship to the book's own thesis or promise.

It is not a list of PDFs, an annotated bibliography, or one summary paragraph per author. Organize it by themes, positions, methods, historical periods, or concepts so relationships between sources are visible.

Minimum contents:

1. guiding question and relationship to the book promise
2. review mode, scope, cutoff date, languages, and disciplines
3. search locations, terms, dates, and screening method
4. inclusion and exclusion rules, including what was not searched
5. source and position map
6. critical appraisal of strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, and likely bias
7. consensus, disagreement, uncertainty, and contrary evidence
8. what is known, unknown, and contested
9. implications for the blueprint, claim map, and wording boundary
10. open gaps and the next research controller

### 3. Source digest and provenance

Each source receives a stable source ID and a record of what it can and cannot support.

Minimum source fields:

```text
source_id
full_citation
source_tier
source_type
source_role
claim_ids
unit_ids
exact_locator
quote_or_paraphrase
limitations_or_bias
accessed_at
snapshot_or_local_path
rights_or_permission_status
verification_status
notes
```

Use these source states when useful: `planned`, `located`, `read`, `appraised`, `extracted`, `claim_mapped`, `checked`, `used`, `superseded`, and `needs_replacement`.

Source tiers:

- `PRIMARY`  -  original study, dataset, archive, official record, firsthand interview, original document, or direct observation.
- `AUTHORITATIVE_SECONDARY`  -  systematic review, scholarly monograph, professional consensus, specialist reference, or high-quality institutional synthesis.
- `INSTITUTIONAL`  -  government, university, professional body, standards organization, or established archive.
- `TERTIARY_ORIENTATION`  -  textbook, encyclopedia, quality journalism, or overview used mainly to orient and find stronger sources.
- `LEAD_ONLY`  -  blog, social post, unsourced page, or search result used only to locate a stronger source or document a phenomenon that is itself the subject.

### 4. Reference planning and search log

After the provisional blueprint, create source tasks for every unit. A planned source is a research task, not a verified citation. Record search attempts, results screened, inclusion or exclusion decisions, and unresolved gaps.

### 5. Citation verification

After a draft exists, map every major factual, health, historical, technical, legal, or numerical claim to a checked source record. Record the exact page, section, figure, table, timestamp, archive item, DOI, PubMed record, publisher page, interview record, or stable URL when available.

Reader-facing citations may remain simple and accessible. The internal register must retain enough metadata and locators for another person to verify the claim.

```text
planned -> located -> read -> appraised -> extracted -> claim_mapped -> checked -> used
                                                            -> superseded
                                                            -> needs_replacement
```

## Claim, citation, and evidence standard

`CLAIM_MAP.md` is the bridge between the literature review and the manuscript.

For each high-impact claim record: claim ID, exact wording, unit ID, claim class, evidence class, source IDs, locator, limitations, counter-evidence, citation status, owner, and the strongest wording the evidence permits.

Claim classes should distinguish `FACT`, `INTERPRETATION`, `DERIVED_RELATION`, `HYPOTHESIS`, `ADVICE`, and `SPECULATION`.

Distinguish source roles:

- `CONSULTED`  -  read or considered during research
- `SUPPORTING`  -  selected to support a specific claim
- `CITED`  -  appears in the reader-facing citation or note
- `COUNTER_EVIDENCE`  -  qualifies or challenges the claim
- `BACKGROUND`  -  informs framing but does not support a specific assertion

Do not turn a correlation into causation, a fit into a prediction, an internal rerun into external validation, a plausible mechanism into a proved result, or an author's synthesis into an established fact.
## Minimum book package

Every active book should expose or locally maintain the following, using existing canonical filenames when they already exist:

```text
README.md
BOOK_MANIFEST.json
RESEARCH_BRIEF.md or equivalent
RESEARCH_DESIGN.md or equivalent
book blueprint or existing outline file
LITERATURE_REVIEW.md or 2_digest/LITERATURE_REVIEW.md
REFERENCE_REGISTER.md
SOURCE_DIGEST.md or 2_digest/
CLAIM_MAP.md
VERIFICATION_SPEC.md
STYLE_SHEET.md
PERMISSIONS_REGISTER.md when applicable
UPDATE_LOG.md
1_raw/       local-only source material
ch_drafts/   local-only working drafts
```

For a sectioned three-book project, the parent package additionally contains:

```text
SECTION_MANIFEST.json
SECTION_BLUEPRINT.md
SECTION_RESEARCH_DESIGN.md
SECTION_LITERATURE_REVIEW.md
SECTION_CLAIM_MAP.md
VOLUME_MATRIX.md
DEPENDENCY_MAP.md
SHARED_TERMS.md
SECTION_UPDATE_LOG.md
```

Do not create semantic aliases merely to satisfy this list. If an existing book uses another filename or folder convention, record the mapping in its README or manifest.

An evidence-led book cannot pass W05 without a literature review, source register, and claim map. A production release cannot pass W17 without the final manifest, registry, public manifest, and update log agreeing.
## Gate model and detailed requirements

Use one of these states for every gate: `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_OPEN_ITEMS`, `BLOCKED`, or `SUPERSEDED`.

Every gate record exposes `gate_id`, `status`, `owner`, `completed_at`, `artifact_paths`, `decision`, `open_items`, `controlling_blocker`, `next_controller`, and `claim_boundary`.

- Pass: every post-publication change has a reason, scope, date, reviewer, and version boundary.
- Return: open a correction or new-edition wave.

## Manuscript integrity and in-place edit protocol

For an existing manuscript, the default is controlled in-place enrichment: preserve original prose and structure unless the request explicitly authorizes a rewrite, deletion, merge, or reorder.

Before an edit:

- identify the canonical file and working branch
- record a hash or snapshot when practical
- record counts, unit IDs, headings, tables, reference sections, links, figures, and protected passages
- state the exact allowed scope and expected output

After an edit:

- rerun relevant structural and content checks
- compare the before/after manifest, not just the final line count
- verify no unplanned unit, paragraph, citation, link, table, or figure disappeared
- inspect changed claims for evidence and wording drift
- record the change, verifier, result, unresolved issue, and next wave in `UPDATE_LOG.md`

Line count, header count, or a passing script is an integrity signal only. It is not proof that the research, citations, argument, or language are correct.

## Editorial layers

Keep these layers separate:

- developmental editing: content, organization, argument, genre, audience, and big-picture revision
- line editing: sentence and paragraph language, rhythm, clarity, tone, and style
- copyediting: grammar, usage, punctuation, cross-references, terminology, and style-sheet consistency
- proofreading: final proof, typographical errors, formatting, and comparison against the edited manuscript
- fact-checking: deeper verification of factual assertions, especially in history and narrative non-fiction
- permissions management: copyright ownership, licenses, attribution, and approval records

A single person may perform more than one role, but the work product and gate remain distinguishable.

## Book-type profiles

- Evidence-led theory or research non-fiction: complete W02-W10, including a real literature review and claim map.
- Popular science or public knowledge: usually `NARRATIVE_CRITICAL`; retain source digest, contrary evidence, and fact audit even when reader-facing citations are light.
- History or biography: use `ARCHIVAL_SOURCE_CRITICISM`, primary-source provenance, corroboration, interview records, and higher W15 sensitivity review for living people or private information.
- Memoir or experience-led writing: use primary-source documentation for factual claims; use targeted literature review for health, psychology, history, or social claims.
- Fiction or creative non-fiction: use targeted research for technical, historical, cultural, or real-person material; real-world assertions still enter fact and rights gates.

## Human and AI roles

Humans decide research scope, source authority, claim class, uncertainty, ethical risk, permissions, final wording, and publication status.

AI may discover leads, summarize a checked source, build tables, compare drafts, identify missing citations, and run structural audits. AI output is never itself a source. AI must not invent citations, fill missing evidence, silently rewrite protected prose, or promote a gate.

## Review gates

The detailed gate requirements above are normative. A gate passes only when its named artifact and pass condition are checked.

Human review is required before publication state or claim boundary is promoted. AI may draft, map, compare, and audit; it may not promote evidence by itself.
## Wave contract

Each completed wave records:

1. what artifact changed
2. what was reviewed or rerun
3. what blocker narrowed
4. what controls the next wave
5. whether claim wording changed

The book's `UPDATE_LOG.md` is the detailed handoff. The repo `WORK_LEDGER/`
records the completed section at repository level when appropriate.

## Version rule

Use wave names and one canonical working draft rather than many large duplicate
manuscript files:

```text
W06 Draft 1
W07 author review
W08 Draft 2
W10 fact/citation audit
W12 Draft 3 editorial revision
W16 release proof
W17 publish/archive
```

Git history plus `UPDATE_LOG.md` is the normal version trail. A separate
snapshot is only needed for a meaningful milestone or external handoff.

## Applying the standard to a book

For a book inside a three-book Section, inspect the parent Section package first. The Section gates decide the allowed role, dependencies, handoffs, and claim boundary of the local book.

For a new or existing book:

1. inspect the existing canonical folder and registry entry
2. preserve the book's current voice, structure, and filenames
3. add the minimum workflow package where the book's policy allows it
4. declare the current process stage, claim boundary, and controlling blocker
5. if the Section/Book plan is not approved, produce the planning package first; do not begin by asking the author to select a chapter or episode
6. after the plan and blueprint lock, run one approved chapter or episode as a controlled execution unit before applying the workflow to the whole book
7. promote public files only after the registry and public manifest agree

The workflow is reusable across books; the source register, claim map, and local
chapter structure remain book-specific.
