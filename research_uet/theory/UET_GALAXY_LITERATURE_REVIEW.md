# Literature Review: Galaxy Rotation Curves, Dark Matter, and Vacuum Pressure (2026)

## 1. The Core Problem: Missing Mass vs. Modified Gravity
The observed flatness of galaxy rotation curves remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.
*   **Newtonian Expectation:** $v \propto 1/\sqrt{r}$. Velocity should drop at the edge.
*   **Observation:** $v \approx \text{const}$. Velocity stays flat.

### 1.1 Standard Model (ΛCDM) Approach
*   **Hypothesis:** Halo of invisible "Dark Matter" particles (WIMPs).
*   **Problem:** The "Cusp-Core" problem. Simulations predict high-density centers (cusps), but observations show constant-density centers (cores).
*   **Density Dependence:** Standard Dark Matter models often fail to explain why the dark matter distribution seems to track the baryonic (visible) matter so closely (the "Renzo's Rule").

### 1.2 Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)
*   **Hypothesis:** Gravity is modified at low accelerations ($a < a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10} m/s^2$).
*   **Success:** Perfectly predicts the "Radial Acceleration Relation" (RAR) observed in the SPARC database.
*   **Limitation:** It is an *empirical fit*. It describes *how* gravity changes, but not *why*.

### 1.3 Vacuum Modified Gravity (Emerging Field)
*   **Hypothesis:** Gravity arises from the interaction of matter with "Vacuum Pressure" or "Dark Energy".
*   **Key Insight:** Identifying $\Lambda$ (Cosmological Constant) not just as global expansion, but as a local field effect.
*   **Relevant Papers:**
    *   *Lelli et al. (2016):* SPARC database establishes the explicit link between Baryons and Dynamics.
    *   *Milgrom (1983):* The acceleration scale $a_0$ is suspiciously close to $c \sqrt{\Lambda}$.
    *   *Farnes (2018):* "Negative Mass" fluids (Dark Energy) could mimic Dark Matter.

## 2. UET Context: Closing the Gap
UET bridges the gap between MOND (the "How") and Vacuum Physics (the "Why").
*   **Agreement:** UET agrees with MOND that the effect is determined by acceleration/density, not random halos.
*   **Innovation:** UET derives the MOND acceleration scale $a_0$ from the Vacuum Pressure ($\Lambda$) and Entropy Maximization ($\beta CI$).

**Conclusion of Review:**
The scientific community is actively searching for a "Density-Dependent" mechanism to explain Dark Matter. UET's "Unified Density Law" ($Ratio \propto \rho^{-\gamma}$) is a direct, testable candidate for this missing mechanism.
