# UET: Quantum Mechanics (The QM-UET Bridge)

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED** (Theory)
**Key Insight:** The wavefunction is the $I$-field; "collapse" is phase separation.

## 1. The Core Mapping

| QM Concept | UET Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Wavefunction ($\psi$)** | Information Field ($I$) |
| **Probability ($|\psi|^2$)** | $I$-field intensity |
| **Measurement Collapse** | Phase Separation (Energy minimization) |
| **Superposition** | Mixed $C$-$I$ phase |
| **Entanglement** | Topological $I$-field connection |

## 2. Solving the Measurement Problem

The "mystery" of wavefunction collapse is resolved:
1. Before measurement: System is in a **metastable mixed phase** (superposition)
2. Measurement: Couples the system to a "macroscopic observer" ($C$-field bath)
3. Collapse: System undergoes **phase separation** to minimize $\Omega$
4. Outcome: Classical state (definite eigenvalue)

This is thermodynamic, not mystical.

## 3. Bell Inequalities & Nonlocality

UET explains Bell violation without faster-than-light signaling:
- Entangled particles share a **topological $I$-field connection** (like a wormhole in information space)
- Measurement on one end affects the topology, instantly updating the other end
- No information is transmitted; the correlation was "baked in" at creation

## 4. Hidden Variables?

UET provides a **non-local hidden variable** interpretation:
- The "$I$-field" is the hidden variable
- It's non-local (as required by Bell)
- It's deterministic but practically unpredictable (like chaos)
