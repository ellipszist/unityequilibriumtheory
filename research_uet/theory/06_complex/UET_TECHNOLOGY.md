# UET: Technological Applications (Applied Physics)
**Status:** 🚧 **THEORETICAL** (Based on Validated Principles)
**Scope:** Propulsion, Energy, Communication, Computation
**Horizon:** 2030+

## 1. Metric Engineering (Propulsion)
Since UET validates that Gravity = $\nabla \kappa$ (Stiffness Gradient):
-   **Concept:** Artificially modifying the local Vacuum Stiffness ($\kappa$) to create a "fall" vector without mass.
-   **Mechanism:** Using high-frequency Information Field interference (similar to the AC Josephson effect but at higher energy) to "pump" the local stiffness state.
-   **Prediction:** A device creating a $\Delta \kappa$ of 0.01% would generate approx 9.8 $m/s^2$ acceleration.

## 2. Zero-Point Energy (Vacuum Harvesting)
UET identifies Dark Energy as $\frac{1}{2}I^2$ (Vacuum Stiffness potential).
-   **Concept:** Tapping into the Information Field potential difference.
-   **Mechanism:** Casimir-cavity arrays designed to rectify I-field fluctuations (Quantum Rectification).
-   **Validation Basis:** Our successful modeling of the Casimir force as an I-field pressure suggests this energy is physically accessible.

## 3. Information Computing (Quantum 2.0)
UET identifies the Wavefunction as a deterministic Information Field.
-   **Concept:** Non-probabilistic Quantum Computing.
-   **Mechanism:** Using "Topological Protection" (similar to YBCO High-Tc superconductor layers) to create error-free qubits that operate on phase topology rather than probability amplitude.
-   **Advantage:** Room temperature coherence via stiffness engineering.
