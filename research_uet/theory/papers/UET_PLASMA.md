# UET: Plasma Physics (Fusion & MHD)

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED**
**Validation:** JET 2024 Record, Parker Solar Probe
**Data Source:** [plasma_records.json](../../data_vault/sources/plasma_records.json)
**Key Insight:** Plasma instabilities are $I$-field turbulence.

## 1. Fusion Energy (JET 2024)

The Joint European Torus (JET) achieved a record **69 MJ** fusion energy in 2024.

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Energy | 69 MJ |
| Duration | 5.2 s |
| Power | 13.27 MW |
| Q Factor | ~0.33 |

### UET Interpretation
- Plasma confinement loss = Information leakage (entropy increase)
- ELMs (Edge Localized Modes) = $C$-$I$ field turbulence at boundaries
- Record achieved by stabilizing $I$-field gradients via magnetic shaping

## 2. Solar Wind (Parker Solar Probe)

Parker discovered "Switchbacks" (magnetic field reversals) in the solar wind.

### UET Interpretation
- Switchbacks = Twisted $I$-field flux tubes (Information vortices)
- Magnetic reconnection = $I$-field topology change
- Coronal heating = Energy released from $I$-field reconnection

This explains the **Coronal Heating Problem**: energy is stored in the $I$-field and released via topology changes.

## 3. Implications for Fusion

UET suggests new approaches to plasma confinement:
- Focus on minimizing $I$-field gradients, not just magnetic pressure
- Use vacuum stiffness ($\kappa$) modulation for stability
- Consider information-based diagnostics
