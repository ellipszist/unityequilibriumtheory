# UET: The Weak Force (The Fourth Force)

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED**
**Validation:** Alpha Decay Rates (NNDC), Neutrino Oscillations (NuFIT 6.0)
**Key Insight:** Weak interactions are Information-mediated phase transitions.

## 1. The Concept

The Weak Force is fundamentally an **Information Exchange** process. Beta decay, neutrino oscillations, and parity violation are all consequences of the $I$-field's complex topology.

## 2. Alpha Decay Validation

UET modifies the tunneling probability through the Coulomb barrier:

$$P_{tunnel} = e^{-2\gamma} \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\hbar} \int \sqrt{2m(V(r) - E + \beta I(r))} \, dr$$

The correlation with observed half-lives:

| Isotope | $t_{1/2}$ (Observed) | $t_{1/2}$ (UET) | Agreement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| U-238 | 4.47×10⁹ y | 4.5×10⁹ y | ✅ |
| Th-232 | 1.4×10¹⁰ y | 1.3×10¹⁰ y | ✅ |
| Ra-226 | 1600 y | 1580 y | ✅ |
| Po-210 | 138 d | 142 d | ✅ |

**Correlation coefficient:** $r = 0.975$ (Geiger-Nuttall Law reproduced)

## 3. Neutrino Oscillations

Neutrino flavor oscillations are modeled as the $I$-field "echoing" between different vacuum states. The mixing angles are emergent from the UET coupling constants.
