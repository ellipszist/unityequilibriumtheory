# UET: Proposed Experimental Validation (Next Steps)
**Status:** 🚧 **PROPOSAL**
**Goal:** Falsify or Confirm UET via *Predictive* Experiments.

---

## 1. The "Weighted" Capacitor Experiment
**Hypothesis:** If Gravity is a stiffness gradient, high electrostatic energy density ($E^2$) should slightly alter local gravity ($g$) by modifying the vacuum stiffness $\kappa$.
-   **Procedure:** A high-voltage capacitor on a sensitive torsion balance.
-   **Prediction:** Detectable weight change $\Delta W$ proportional to stored energy `U`, distinct from Einstein's $E=mc^2$ contribution.
-   **UET Signature:** Effect should scale with material dielectric stiffness non-linearly.

## 2. The Superconductor Isotope Effect
**Hypothesis:** UET predicts $T_c \propto \kappa$. Vacuum Stiffness $\kappa$ is coupled to nuclear mass density.
-   **Procedure:** Precise measurement of $T_c$ variation in Lead isotopes (Standard) vs High-Tc ceramics.
-   **Prediction:** UET predicts deviations from BCS isotope exponent $\alpha=0.5$ in low-dimension materials due to topological stiffness decoupling.

## 3. The Neutrino-Stiffness Link (Cosmology)
**Hypothesis:** Neutrino mass is an environmental variable proportional to local $\kappa$.
-   **Procedure:** Compare neutrino flavor oscillation baselines in vacuum vs high-density matter (Sun/Earth core).
-   **Prediction:** UET predicts oscillation parameters ($\theta_{13}$) shift in high-stiffness environments (Matter Effect) differently than standard MSW theory.
