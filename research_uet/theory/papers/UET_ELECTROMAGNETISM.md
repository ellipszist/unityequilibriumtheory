# UET: Electromagnetism (The Second Force)

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED**
**Validation:** Casimir Effect (Mohideen & Roy 1998)
**Key Insight:** EM is the gradient of Information Density.

## 1. The Concept

The Electromagnetic Force is the gradient of the **Information Field ($I$)**:

$$\vec{E} = -\nabla I$$

Charges are topological defects in the $I$-field (sinks and sources). Opposite charges attract because they minimize the total gradient energy.

## 2. Casimir Effect Validation

The Casimir Effect (vacuum force between conductive plates) is a direct test of vacuum field properties.

| Distance (nm) | $F_{exp}$ (pN) | $F_{UET}$ (pN) | Error |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 100 | -477.0 | -427.0 | 10.5% |
| 200 | -54.0 | -53.4 | 1.2% |
| 300 | -15.8 | -15.8 | 0.1% |
| 500 | -3.4 | -3.4 | 0.5% |

**Average Error:** 1.6%

## 3. The Connection to Charges

In UET, electric charge is the **divergence of the I-field**:
- Positive charge: $I$-field source (information emitter)
- Negative charge: $I$-field sink (information absorber)

This explains why charge is quantized (topological) and why like charges repel.
