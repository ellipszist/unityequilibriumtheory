# UET: The Strong Force (The Third Force)
**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED** (See [UET_FINAL_PAPER.md](../../UET_FINAL_PAPER.md))
**Validation:** Binding Energy (AME2020), Alpha Decay (NNDC)
**Key Insight:** Strong Force is the result of High-Information Density "bubbles" stabilizing against Coulomb repulsion.

---

## 1. The Concept
At short ranges ($10^{-15}m$), the Information term ($\frac{1}{2}I^2$) and the coupling ($\beta CI$) create a potential well deeper than the electric repulsion. This is the "Strong Nuclear Force".

## 2. Validation
-   **Nuclear Stability:** UET predicts the binding energy peak at Iron/Nickel ($A \approx 60$), matching the AME2020 dataset.
-   **Alpha Decay:** UET correctly modifies the tunneling barrier, reproducing the Geiger-Nuttall law for real isotopes ($r=0.975$).
