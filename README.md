> **Current Repository Scope:** This repository is the main UET research corpus. The source-only prototypes under services_and_experiments/ are retained as a future platform layer, but they are not required for research, books, or policy work and are not a live application, mining network, or production knowledge service. The design intent is preserved as roadmap/prototype context.

## 🎯 6. The Core Equation (Detailed Explanation)

### The Vision

> **"Equality is the Law of Nature."**

$$\boxed{\Omega = C \cdot I}$$

| Symbol | Philosophical Definition | Physical Definition |
|:------:|:-------------------------|:--------------------|
| **Ω (Omega)** | **Balance / Equilibrium** | Total Action / System State |
| **C (Connection)** | **Interaction (Open System)** | Complexity / Connectivity / Light Speed |
| **I (Individualism)** | **Cost of Division (Isolation)** | Mass / Inertia / Latency |

*   **Logic:** A system with high **Interaction (C)** (like the Internet or a Brain) has high potential, but it creates **Division Costs (I)** (Latency/Friction).
*   **Goal:** The universe evolves to find the perfect **Balance ($\Omega$)**.

### The Full Implementation (Field Equation)

This is how we actually calculate physics:

$$\Omega[C,I] = \int \left[ \underbrace{V(C)}_{\text{Cost of Becoming}} + \underbrace{\frac{\kappa}{2}|\nabla C|^2}_{\text{Cost of Change}} + \underbrace{\beta C I}_{\text{The Ethics of Connection}} \right] dx$$

**The Thermodynamics of Ethics:**

- **$V(C)$ — The Cost of Existence**: Nothing is free. To "be" (exist) requires energy.
- **$\nabla C$ — The Cost of Difference**: Diversity creates gradients. Change requires work.
- **$\beta C I$ — The Connection Limit**:
    - **High C (Hyper-connected)**: System becomes chaotic (High Energy).
    - **High I (Hyper-isolated)**: System becomes stagnant (High Mass).
    - **Equilibrium**: Life thrives where Connection matches Capacity.

### Why This Works (The Tree of Physics)

**Translation:**

| Physics | Standard Concept | UET (Ethical Interpretation) |
|:--------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|
| Classical | Force (F) | The drive to resolve Isolation (∇I) |
| Thermo | Entropy (S) | The scrambling of Connection (Loss of C) |
| Relativity | Gravity (g) | The burden of Isolation (Mass = I) |
| Quantum | Wave (ψ) | The search for Connection (Search Algo) |
| Quantum | Collapse | The establishment of a Link (Decision) |

## 💰 Uet-Cash Mining System

**Status:** 🧭 Concept + archived prototype direction | 🚧 Not an active live network

Uet-Cash is a proof-of-useful-work concept, not a live network. Source-only service experiments remain under services_and_experiments/ as future-platform material. A separate implementation repository, security review, and economic/governance design would be required before activation.

### Architecture

```
uet_core (Rust, archived prototype) → UET Master Equation Solver
        ↓
uet_miner (Rust, archived prototype) → Mining Algorithm with Nonce Search
        ↓
uet_security (Rust, archived prototype) → Quantum-Resistant Signatures & Hashing
        ↓
Uet-Cash Blocks → Proof Verification → Uet-Cash Rewards (future network design)
```

### Components

| Component | Status | Description |
|:----------|:-------|:------------|
| **uet_core** | Archived prototype | UET Master Equation in Rust (7-term functional) |
| **uet_miner** | Archived prototype | Mining algorithm concept with nonce search and proof verification |
| **uet_security** | Archived prototype | Quantum-resistant signature/hash design direction |
| **uet_governance** | Future design | Governance system (voting, proposals) - deferred |
| **uet_oracle** | Future design | Oracle infrastructure (verification) - deferred |
| **uet_economic** | Future design | Economic policies (issuance, difficulty) - deferred |
| **uet_market** | Future design | Market infrastructure (AMM, price discovery) - deferred |

### Security Features

**Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**
- Target: Dilithium PQ signatures for block/tx/proof signing
- Target: SHA3/BLAKE3 hashing (quantum-resistant design direction)
- Target: Signature metadata (schema_version, sig_alg, hash_alg, key_id)

**Block Security**
- Target: Header signature verification
- Target: Merkle roots (tx_merkle_root, proof_root)
- Target: State root verification
- Target: Full block validation rules

**Anti-Cheat Controls**
- Target: Replay protection (task_id + node_id + nonce uniqueness)
- Target: Fraud proofs (challenge invalid proofs)
- Target: Epoch-based nonce reset
- Target: Result stealing resistance (signature bound to node_id)

### How Mining Works

1. **Receive Task**: Get UET equation to solve (task_id, input_seed, difficulty)
2. **Solve Equation**: Use `uet_core` to compute UET functional with nonce search
3. **Create Proof**: Generate proof with signature and metadata
4. **Verify Difficulty**: Check if result hash has required leading zeros
5. **Submit Proof**: Send proof (result_hash, nonce, verification_artifact, signature) to network
6. **Get Reward**: Future network design would issue Uet-Cash for valid proof; this is not live in the current research repo.

### Example

```rust
// Historical prototype sketch. The active research repo does not currently
// include these Rust crates at the repository root.
use uet_miner::{MiningTask, TaskFamily, UetCashMiner};
use uet_security::{CryptoSuite, MockSigner, SignatureAlgorithm};

let task = MiningTask {
    task_id: "example".to_string(),
    family: TaskFamily::EquilibriumCertificate,
    input_seed: vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    difficulty: 2, // Require 2 leading zeros
    created_at: 0,
};

let suite = CryptoSuite::default();
let signer = MockSigner::new("node-a", SignatureAlgorithm::Dilithium3);

let miner = UetCashMiner::new(task, "node-a".to_string(), suite);
if let Some(proof) = miner.mine(1000000, &signer) {
    println!("Found proof: {}", proof.result_hash_hex);
}
```

| **"Navier Stokes Smoothness proof"** | Fluid turbulence is proved to be smooth ($C^\infty$) when modeled as an *Energy Minimization* problem on a 4D manifold. | [0.10](./docs/topics/0.10_Fluid_Dynamics_Chaos/) |
| **"Calculate Vacuum Energy Density"** | By applying a *Plank-scale Information Cutoff*, we calculate $\Lambda \approx 10^{-9} J/m^3$, matching Dark Energy observations (avoiding $10^{120}$ error). | [0.12](./docs/topics/0.12_Vacuum_Energy_Casimir/) |
| **"Origin of Mass"** | Mass is the *Coupling Strength* to the Information Field. Heavier particles have higher informational complexity (drag). | [0.17](./docs/topics/0.17_Mass_Generation/) |
